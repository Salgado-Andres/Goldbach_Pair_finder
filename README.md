# Goldbach_Pair_finder
This is the program for finding Goldbach pair for a even number in O(n^1.5) time complexity and O(1) Space Complexity
Goldbach conjecture states that any even positive integer greater than 2 can be expressed as a sum of two primes and this program findes a pair of primes that the entered even number is a sum of.
I hope you like and enjoy it

## Goldbach_Collapse.py

`Goldbach_Collapse.py` is an educational script that enumerates **all** prime pairs for an even integer greater than 2. It includes comments and log messages referencing the Salgado Information Matrix ψ⁰→φ⁰ collapse model. The script uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes for efficient prime generation and displays a simple matplotlib visualization showing the symmetry of each pair about `n/2`.

Run it with Python 3 and have `matplotlib` installed:

```bash
python3 Goldbach_Collapse.py
```
